# My Coursework Setup Notes

## Tasks from TEMPLATE Repo

- [x] Visited example board: [CYF Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/projects/126/)
- [x] Learned how to create and manage GitHub Issues
- [ ] Practice updating fields and adding issues to board
- [ ] Check total time of all tasks in my sprint (should not be more than 20 hrs)
- [ ] Explore GitHub Actions and understand how they help automate projects

## My Understanding So Far

- The planner repo helps me track all coursework across modules.
- Issues are like tasks â€” I can move them between columns.
- Pull Requests help me share work and get feedback.

## Questions

- How do I link a PR to a specific issue?
- Can I test Actions on my own fork?
